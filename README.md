# Code Refactor: Horiseon

## Code Refactor Homework Assignment

This assignment's objective was to optimize the code for a webpage to make it more accessible. Changes were made to both the HTML and CSS files to reach this objective. Most, if not all, div elements were replaced with semantic elements that correspond to the code that it contains. Redundant classes, id's, and code were consolidated as much as possible.
